***Congratulations!*** 

You've successfully created an Azure SQL Database and its dependencies using Pulumi and TypeScript. 
You've learned how to set up a Pulumi project, define Azure resources, deploy them, and clean up afterward. 

This approach empowers you to manage cloud infrastructure using code, providing reproducibility and maintainability.

Feel free to explore further with Pulumi and Azure, and adapt this foundation to your specific infrastructure needs.
